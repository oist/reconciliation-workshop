[00:00:00] AleRax v1.3.0
[00:00:00] AleRax was called as follows:
../aleraxApr --families blue_families.txt --species-tree S.tree --prefix blueApril --gene-tree-samples 10000 --seed 42 --rec-model UndatedDTL --model-parametrization GLOBAL

[00:00:00] Run settings:
	Output directory: blueApril
	Families information: blue_families.txt
	Starting species tree: will be imported from the user file: S.tree
	MPI Ranks: 1
	Random seed: 42
	Reconciliation model: UndatedDTL
	Transfer constraint: transfers to parents are forbidden
	Memory savings: OFF
	Model parametrization: rates are global to all species and families
	Rate optimizer: LBFGSB
	Prune species mode is disabled
	Gene tree rooting: all gene tree root positions are considered with the same probability
	Origination strategy: gene families can originate from each species with the same probability
	Species tree search: skipping species tree search
	Number of reconciled gene trees to sample: 10000
	AleRax will exclude gene families covering less than 4 species
