[00:00:00] AleRax v1.3.0
[00:00:00] AleRax was called as follows:
alerax -f families.txt -s abcd_S.tree -p abcd

[00:00:00] Run settings:
	Output directory: abcd
	Families information: families.txt
	Starting species tree: will be imported from the user file: abcd_S.tree
	MPI Ranks: 1
	Random seed: 123
	Reconciliation model: UndatedDTL
	Transfer constraint: transfers to parents are forbidden
	Memory savings: OFF
	Model parametrization: rates are global to all species and families
	Rate optimizer: LBFGSB
	Prune species mode is disabled
	Gene tree rooting: all gene tree root positions are considered with the same probability
	Origination strategy: gene families can originate from each species with the same probability
	Species tree search: skipping species tree search
	Number of reconciled gene trees to sample: 100
	AleRax will exclude gene families covering less than 4 species
