[00:00:00] AleRax was called as follow:
../alerax --families Hemoglobin.families 

[00:00:00] Run settings:
	Family file: Hemoglobin.families
	Starting species tree: specified by user: 
	Output directory: alerax_output
	MPI Ranks: 1
	Number of reconciled gene trees to sample: 100
	Random seed: 123
	Reconciliation model: UndatedDTL
	Model parametrization:  global to all species and families
Rate optimizer: LBFGSB
	Memory savings: OFF
	Transfer constraints: transfers to parents are forbidden
	Prune species mode is disabled
	Gene tree rooting: all gene tree root positions are considered with the same probability
	Origination strategy: gene families can originate from each species with the same probability
	Species tree search: skipping species tree search
	AleRax will exclude gene families covering less than 1 species
