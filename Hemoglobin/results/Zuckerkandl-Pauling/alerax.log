[00:00:00] AleRax v1.2.0
[00:00:00] AleRax was called as follow:
../alerax --families Zuckerkandl-Pauling.families --species-tree data/HuHoCo.sptree --prefix Zuckerkandl-Pauling --gene-tree-samples 10 --seed 42 --rec-model UndatedDL --model-parametrization GLOBAL 

[00:00:00] Run settings:
	Family file: Zuckerkandl-Pauling.families
	Starting species tree: specified by user: data/HuHoCo.sptree
	Output directory: Zuckerkandl-Pauling
	You are running GeneRax without MPI (no parallelization)
	Number of reconciled gene trees to sample: 10
	Random seed: 42
	Reconciliation model: UndatedDL
	Model parametrization:  global to all species and families
Rate optimizer: LBFGSB
	Memory savings: OFF
	Transfer constraints: transfers to parents are forbidden
	Prune species mode is disabled
	Gene tree rooting: all gene tree root positions are considered with the same probability
	Origination strategy: gene families can originate from each species with the same probability
	Species tree search: skipping species tree search
	AleRax will exclude gene families covering less than 1 species
